This is my own branch of the LiquidRP project. The original Liquid DarkRP was by Jackool and then Deadman123, and I updated it for Garry's Mod 13. I hope to continue building LiquidRP in an enjoyable gamemode.

Plans
======
On a large scale, I plan to do the following:

* Merge with the latest version of DarkRP (modularizing this gamemode to fit with DarkRP's framework in the process)
* Ease the installation of addons (possibly by tweaking the whitelist system)
* More customizing - see the wiki!
