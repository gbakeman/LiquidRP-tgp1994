This is my own branch of the LiquidRP project. The original Liquid DarkRP was by Jackool and then Deadman123, and I updated it for Garry's Mod 13. I hope to continue building LiquidRP in an enjoyable gamemode.

Current Task
======
Oh boy, here goes.

I'm still very new to Git. I had the SVN repository set up originally so that certain files were pulled directly from DarkRP, so Falco could keep doing his thing to keep DarkRP updated, and I could keep doing my thing to keep LiquidRP upated and compatible with DarkRP. That introduced the problem where if an update to DarkRP was pushed that breaks something in LiquidRP, then LiquidRP was broken.

Plusses and minuses aside, it looks like I can't do the file dependancy thing with Git. What I think I'll start doing now is a huge clean up. I'll try to get the file structure as close to DarkRP right now as possible, and I'll try to start modularizing LiquidRP, so at some point, LiquidRP can be turned into a module its self... hopefully.

Plans
======
On a large scale, I plan to do the following:

* Merge with the latest version of DarkRP (modularizing this gamemode to fit with DarkRP's framework in the process)
* Ease the installation of addons (possibly by tweaking the whitelist system)
* More customizing - see the wiki!
